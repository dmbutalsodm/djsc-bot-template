## djsc-bot-template ##
This repository that serves as a template for Discord.js-commando bots. I made it because I found myself cloning the same code over and over again whenever I would make a new bot, so this just made more sense. It has the client setup, a couple example events registered, proper folder architecture, and most importantly the settingsprovider is initialised and an empty database provided.
